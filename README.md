About
=====
Evo Class Index is much quicker alternative to every run-time annotation scanning library like Reflections or Scannotations.

Evo Class Index is an annotation processor which at compile-time generates an index of classes implementing given interface, classes annotated by given annotation or placed in a common package. Java 6 will automatically [discover](http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=269) the processor from the classpath. 


Usage
=====
There are two annotations which trigger the indexing:

* [@IndexSubclasses](http://www.atteo.org/static/evo-classindex/apidocs/org/atteo/evo/classindex/IndexSubclasses.html) when placed on interface makes an index of all classes implementing the interface, when placed on class makes an index of its subclasses and finally when placed in package-info.java it creates an index of all classes in that package.
* [@IndexAnnotated](http://www.atteo.org/static/evo-classindex/apidocs/org/atteo/evo/classindex/IndexAnnotated.html) when placed on an annotation makes an index of all classes marked with that annotation.
To access the index at run-time use static methods of [ClassIndex](http://www.atteo.org/static/evo-classindex/apidocs/org/atteo/evo/classindex/ClassIndex.html) class.

```java
@IndexAnnotated
public @interface Entity {
}
 
@Entity
public class Car {
}
 
...
 
for (Class<?> klass : ClassIndex.getAnnotated(Entity.class)) {
    System.out.println(klass.getName());
}
```

For subclasses of the given class the index file name and format is compatible with what [ServiceLoader](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html) expects. Keep in mind that ServiceLoader also requires for the classes to have zero-argument default constructor.

For classes inside given package the index file is named "jaxb.index", it is located inside the package folder and it's format is compatible with what [JAXBContext.newInstance(String)](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/xml/bind/JAXBContext.html#newInstance(java.lang.String)) expects.
